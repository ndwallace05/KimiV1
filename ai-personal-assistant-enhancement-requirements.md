## 3. Core Process

**Main User Flow:**
User opens the AI Chat Interface and interacts with the conversational AI using natural language. The AI processes requests, creates tasks/habits, provides insights, and suggests optimizations. Users can switch to the Smart Dashboard for analytics, use Voice Commands for hands-free interaction, configure Automation workflows, and review detailed Analytics. The system continuously learns from user behavior to improve recommendations.

**AI-Driven Automation Flow:**
The system monitors user patterns, biometric data, and external triggers to automatically create tasks, send smart notifications, optimize schedules, and execute predefined workflows without manual intervention.
